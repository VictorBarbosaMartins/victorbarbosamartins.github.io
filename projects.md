## Research projects

### 2023 
- **The Simulation Pipeline (SimPipe) for CTA**
The DPPS Simulation Production Pipeline (SimPipe) is the system responsible to simulate the response of CTAO telescopes and model the relevant air shower physics and atmospheric conditions. It manages and validates the simulation model for the measurement processes and allows to produce event level simulated data for data levels MC-R1 and MC-DL0 from these validated MC models. SimPipe provides the necessary software, workflow definitions, data models and databases for the simulation model validation and MC production.

### 2018 - 2020
- **The structure health monitoring system for the Medium-sized telescope (MST) of CTA**
The main goal of the monitoring is to detect degradation and failures before critical damages occur, through the estimate of the Eigenfrequencies of the telescope and their damping rates and their monitoring over time. The structure monitoring concept system was applied to the prototype Medium Size telescope (MST) prototype of CTA in Berlin during late 2018 and in 2019. The system is also capable to detect mechanical changes, e.g. varying tension in the steel ropes of the camera support structure. The successful implementation of the structure monitoring system supports the decision of implementing the system in all future MSTs.

### 2016 - 2018
- **Developement, construction and tests of 40 Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) for the Pierre Auger Observatory**
Resistive Plate Chambers have shown to be suitable muon detector to be integrated into the Pierre Auger Observatory. We have built 40 units at USP in Sao Carlos (Brazil) with help of our colleagues from LIP, Coimbra, Portugal. The RPCs were mounted and succesfully tested.
